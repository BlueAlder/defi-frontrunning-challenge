# Front Run Challenge

This is a challenge to showcase  a front running exploit on the ETH blockchain. This is built using hardhat network. 

## Challenge Overview

Alice has deployed a vault contract located in `contracts/Vault.sol` which has 10 ETH stored in it. To retrieve the ETH the sender must prove they know the secret bytes which hash to the value stored when the contract was deployed. 

Alice is about to withdraw the ETH from the vault. Your job is to take the ETH before Alice does without knowing the password (at least initally ðŸ˜‰).
